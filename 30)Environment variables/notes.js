/*

The most important environment which use are

Development environment (default)
Production environment

if we log
app.get('env') stores the type of environment we are using (env is a environment variable set by nodejs like pre defined variable)

process.env  shows all the environment variables that exist


to use process module we need not require it like fs module because it is available everywhere automatically

=>Setting custom environment variables

If we define a variable of our choice in the terminal then that variable will become an environment variable

Ex: SET x=100 inside the terminal will make it an environemnt variable

These variables are mainly used to set the the use the data of different databases based on the environment we use

//Configuration file - File which stores all environment variables
